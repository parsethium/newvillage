Born in Iran, raised in Malaysia and Sweden, and now based in the Netherlands—I’ve moved around a lot. Through all the changes, New Village has been the one thing that stayed with me.

My drawings are instinctual and free-flowing. They begin without a plan—just lines that slowly take shape. Sometimes they don’t mean anything at all. Other times, they reveal something to me much later, when I’ve grown enough to understand them.

This path has been full of learning, unlearning, and a lot of self-discovery. It’s easy to get pulled away from what you love. We’re often pushed toward what makes sense to others, even when it doesn’t feel right to us. Choosing to walk away from that pressure feels uncertain—but also freeing.

That’s why I’m here. I’m choosing to show up for my work, for myself, and for the version of me that’s been quietly building New Village all along.
